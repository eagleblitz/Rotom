# Localization
Rotom partially relies on localization files for all Discord outputs.

# Specification (Skip if you just want to translate)

```yaml
"source":
    "zhCN": "来源"
    "enUS": ~ # Set as null if the original string is in this language
```

Example:
```yaml
"Hello, world!":
    "enUS": ~
    "zhCN": "你好，世界！"
```
