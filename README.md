# Rotom
**NOTE:** This repo is still a WIP.

Rotom is a Discord bot designed with extensibility and modularity in mind.

## TODO

- Remove `api` section from `config_template.yml` and follow the way RoboDanny implemented Carbonitex (`api` folder in cogs)

## Requirement

- Python 3.5+
- RethinkDB

### Modules

- `rewrite` branch of `discord.py`
- `ruamel.yaml`

## Installation

**NOTE**: This section is a WIP.

## Warnings
