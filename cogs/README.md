## Extensions (cogs)
Rotom supports all cogs written for discord.py, but there's no guarantee that every extrensions will:
- Support both async and rewrite version of `discord.py`
- Use Rotom's non-standard features
- Supporting Rotom at all (due to possible usage of other bots' non-standard features)
**NOTE**: By non-standard I mean anything that's not officially included inside discord.py (and usually written by third-party)

### Writing extensions
**NOTE**: Everything under this section, including the sub-sections, should support other bots written in `discord.py`'s `command` extension unless Rotom's non-standard features were used.

TBD
#### Multi-file extensions
Refer to `cogs` folder -> `cog_website` folder and `website.py`.
